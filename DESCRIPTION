Title: Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments (CREDI) Multi-Dimensional Item Factor Analysis Scoring
Description: Produces composite scores of early childhood development using raw item-level response data collected with the Caregiver Reported Early Development Instruments <https://credi.gse.harvard.edu/> (CREDI) and input by the user. The score() function accepts user data either directly through the R session, or through an interactive dialogue. If data are properly named, the package calculates CREDI Overall and domain scores, estimated standard errors of measurement, and norm-referenced Z-scores and produces a log of potential scoring issues and errors. The package uses the scoring algorithms reported in Waldman, McCoy, Seiden, Cuartas, and Fink (2021) <doi:10.1177/01650254211005560>.
